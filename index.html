                            <p class="barlow align-middle">Celtic Biotech is an Irish bio-pharmaceutical company developing novel peptides for the treatment of solid tumours, with a specific focus on non-small cell lung cancer. With current treatments often falling short in efficacy, safety, and patient convenience, the Company has identified promising naturally derived receptor binding proteins, one of which, CB-24 crotoxin, it has progressed into Phase I trials using a novel intra-patient dose escalating protocol.</p>
                            <p class="barlow align-middle">The drug has shown excellent safety, minimal side-effects and stabilisation of disease in several  patients in Phase Ib (6 patients evaluated) multi-cancer trials. Delivered as a user friendly at-home monotherapy using infusion pumps, the patients are monitored remotely requiring visits to clinic twice weekly for dose escalation.  Part funded by the European Innovation Council, Phase Ic clinical trials will commence in 2024 to identify MTD and optimum treatment protocol, with a view to commencing Phase II trials in NSCLC 2025/26, in this potentially game-changing cancer therapeutic.</p>
